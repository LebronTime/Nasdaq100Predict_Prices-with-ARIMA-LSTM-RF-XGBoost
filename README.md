# Nasdaq100Predict_Prices-with-ARIMA-LSTM-RF-XGBoost

## What is this project?
This project focuses on predicting the prices of the Nasdaq 100 index using a combination of machine learning and statistical models. We employed ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost to forecast future prices. The primary goal is to determine which model provides the most accurate predictions by comparing the predicted values to actual historical prices.

## Why did we do it?
Developing this project served several key purposes:
- **Exploring Predictive Models:** To explore and compare the performance of both statistical (ARIMA) and machine learning models (LSTM, RF, XGBoost) in predicting stock prices.
- **Understanding Market Trends:** To better understand how different models handle complex and volatile financial data, such as the Nasdaq 100 index.
- **Providing a Visual Insight:** To create visual comparisons between actual prices and predicted prices, helping in the analysis and decision-making processes in stock trading strategies.

## What are the gains from doing this project?
- **Performance Analysis:** By evaluating each modelâ€™s performance, we gain insights into which approach is better suited for financial time series forecasting.
- **Hands-On Machine Learning & Data Science:** The project enhances practical skills in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and tuning.
- **Versatility:** The comparison provides a comprehensive overview of different predictive methods, helping users select the most appropriate model for similar tasks.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of historical Nasdaq 100 prices sourced from Yahoo Finance. The dataset includes:
- **Date:** The date of each recorded price.
- **Open, High, Low, Close Prices:** The range of prices during the trading period.
- **Volume:** The volume of shares traded.

## Results & Visualizations
The project includes visual graphs that compare actual prices with the predicted prices from each model. The key objective is to highlight which model (ARIMA, LSTM, RF, XGBoost) produces the most accurate forecasts based on metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
